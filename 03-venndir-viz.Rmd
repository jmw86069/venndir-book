*"How did we end up here?" - James M. Ward*

The core features of a Venn diagram seem so simple and straightforward.
A Venn diagram uses circles, and sometimes ellipses, to organize shared
and distinct summary counts in each set.

Proportional Venn diagrams are called Euler diagrams, and use circles
or ellipses whose area is sizes proportional to the size of each set.
These circles are placed so that the overlapping area is very close
to the proportional number of items shared between two sets.
