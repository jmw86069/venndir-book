Ward 2025-01-25 Chapter 1 About This book describes the venndir R package, intended for the display of Venn diagrams with directionality. The visualizations are the product of many years creating Venn diagrams, working many fantastic colleagues and incorporating their ideas and mine together. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.1 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. 1.2 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["what-is-a-directional-venn-diagram.html", "Chapter 2 What is a directional Venn diagram? 2.1 Problem Statement 2.2 Slightly more detail", " Chapter 2 What is a directional Venn diagram? 2.1 Problem Statement “What problem are you trying to solve?” – Lazar Arulnayagam When comparing biological changes across two experiments, the direction of change is very important to the interpretation of results. Specifically, when genes are affected by disease, or treatment, some genes may increase in abundance, other genes may decrease. In a Venn diagram, it is very useful to see when the directionality is concordant (shared), or discordant (not shared). 2.2 Slightly more detail I often study gene expression, which is a huge topic in itself. Stated as simply as I know how, gene expression is the process by which a living organism “expresses” the information encoded in its genome. The genome contains many individual units referred to as “genes”, which represents the instructions for each functional gene locus. A gene is “expressed” by copying the genome DNA to a “transcript” RNA. The transcript RNA may be in the form of “messenger RNA” or mRNA, which is also later translated in the cell into a corresponding protein. The particular genes which are expressed, and the quantity of those expressed genes, collectively determines the functional state of a living system. For multi-cellular organisms like human, each living cell has a unique signature of gene expression, defined by the overall gene abundances which are expressed in that cell. Significant changes to the gene expression occur during natural conditions like exercise, after eating a meal, or as consequence of disease like viral infection, injury, or cancer. During our experiments, we frequently want to identify “which genes changed” when compared to some normal reference state. For example, when we compare viral infected cells to normal cells, we identify which genes are different from normal. Here comes the directionality: Some genes will be higher than normal, and other genes with be lower than normal. Examples Show example Venn without directionality.

"],["data-import.html", "Chapter 3 Data Import 3.1 Import using a list 3.2 Convert to list", " Chapter 3 Data Import The first key step in using Venndir is to import data in a recognized format. There are several formats available: R list of character vectors containing the items. R list of numeric vectors, whose names() represent items. The numeric values are 1 is “Up”, and -1 is “Down”. If all items in all sets are 1, then the data is assumed to be non-directional. Incidence matrix, which is a numeric matrix where the items are rownames(), and sets are colnames(), and the matrix values are 0 when there is no item, and 1 when there is a value. Overlap counts, a numeric vector with the number of counts in each unique overlap set. This input is non-directional, meaning there is no “Up” nor “Down” to display. For example, c(A=15, B=20, \"A&amp;B\"=5) is sufficient to define a Venn diagram. Signed overlap counts, a list that contains numeric vectors. This is an advanced form of “Overlap counts”, using the same names() format: “A”, “B”, “A&amp;B”. However, each element is a numeric vector named by the directionality. This is an advanced topic and not generally recommended. 3.1 Import using a list 3.2 Convert to list 3.2.1 Incidence matrix 3.2.2 Signed incidence matrix 3.2.3 Overlap counts 3.2.4 Signed overlap counts "],["venndir-visualization.html", "Chapter 4 Venndir Visualization 4.1 Venn Basics", " Chapter 4 Venndir Visualization “How did we end up here?” - James M. Ward The core features of a Venn diagram seem so simple and straightforward. A Venn diagram uses circles, and sometimes ellipses, to organize shared and distinct summary counts in each set. Proportional Venn diagrams are called Euler diagrams, and use circles or ellipses whose area is sizes proportional to the size of each set. These circles are placed so that the overlapping area is very close to the proportional number of items shared between two sets. 4.1 Venn Basics 4.1.1 Colors and Styles 4.1.2 Fonts and Font Sizes 4.1.3 Venn Legend "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
