# About

This book describes the `venndir` R package, intended for the display
of Venn diagrams with directionality. The visualizations are the product
of many years creating Venn diagrams, working many fantastic colleagues
and incorporating their ideas and mine together.

*The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.*

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.


## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
